Hi, I am Mubdiu - a creative with your security posture at heart. Always trying to resolve your risk and compliance headaches 😊

With 5 years of experience spanning project management, information security, and architecture, I've delivered results with empathy and ensured stakeholder profitability. 
My consultant mindset has honed skills in collaboration, presentation, and policy integration while prioritizing people's inclusion with equity.

As a versatile entrepreneur, I've founded a talent management company, a logistics venture, and spearheaded an autism awareness campaign in my community.

Currently, I'm excelling in my transition to the information security industry, simplifying complex concepts for clients from various sectors through my weekly notes on GRC. Embracing diverse cultures and mindsets as a global citizen is my ongoing focus.

Proudly, I've achieved a distinction in my master's and continue to evolve professionally. 
I excel in analytical topics, empathize with clients, and constantly refine my understanding of SOX, NIST, COBIT, PCI DSS and other global governance standards to inform risk assessment and compliance adherence.

My creative spark ignites when given a blank sheet of paper, a pen, and music. As an architect, problem-solving graphically comes naturally to me. With my trifecta , there's no challenge I can't tackle. Ready to put me to the test? Reach out! 📝🎶
